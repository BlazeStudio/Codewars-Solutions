# A Rule of Divisibility by 13

# From Wikipedia:
#
# "A divisibility rule is a shorthand way of determining whether a given integer is divisible by a fixed divisor without performing the division, usually by examining its digits."
#
# When you divide the successive powers of 10 by 13 you get the following remainders of the integer divisions:
#
# 1, 10, 9, 12, 3, 4 because:
#
# 10 ^ 0 ->  1 (mod 13)
# 10 ^ 1 -> 10 (mod 13)
# 10 ^ 2 ->  9 (mod 13)
# 10 ^ 3 -> 12 (mod 13)
# 10 ^ 4 ->  3 (mod 13)
# 10 ^ 5 ->  4 (mod 13)
#
# (For "mod" you can see:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation)
#
# Then the whole pattern repeats. Hence the following method:
#
# Multiply
# - the right most digit of the number with the left most number
# in the sequence shown above,
# - the second right most digit with the second left most digit of the number in the sequence.
#
# The cycle goes on and you sum all these products. Repeat this process until the sequence of sums is stationary.
#
# Example:
# What is the remainder when 1234567 is divided by 13?
# 7      6     5      4     3     2     1  (digits of 1234567 from the right)
# ×      ×     ×      ×     ×     ×     ×  (multiplication)
# 1     10     9     12     3     4     1  (the repeating sequence)
# Therefore following the method we get:
#
# We repeat the process with the number 178:
#
# `8x1 + 7x10 + 1x9 = 87`
#
# and again with 87:
#
# `7x1 + 8x10 = 87`
#
# From now on the sequence is **stationary** (we always get `87`) and the remainder of `1234567` by `13` is
# the same as the remainder of `87` by `13` ( i.e `9`).
#
# #### Task:
#
# Write a function which processes this sequence of operations on an integer `n (>=0)` and returns the **stationary** number.
#
# ### Examples
#
# * for `n = 1234567` it calculates `178`, then `87`, then `87` and returns `87`.
# * for `n = 321` it calculates `48`, `48` and returns `48`
