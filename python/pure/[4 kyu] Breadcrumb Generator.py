# Breadcrumb Generator

#As breadcrumb men√πs are quite popular today, I won't digress much on explaining them, leaving the wiki link to do all the dirty work in my place.
#
# What might not be so trivial is instead to get a decent breadcrumb from your current url. For this kata, your purpose is to create a function that takes a url, strips the first part (labelling it always HOME) and then builds it making each element but the last a <a> element linking to the relevant path; last has to be a <span> element getting the active class.
#
# All elements need to be turned to uppercase and separated by a separator, given as the second parameter of the function; the last element can terminate in some common extension like .html, .htm, .php or .asp; if the name of the last element is index.something, you treat it as if it wasn't there, sending users automatically to the upper level folder.

# Seems easy enough?
#
# Well, probably not so much, but we have one last extra rule: if one element (other than the root/home) is longer than 30 characters, you have to shorten it, acronymizing it (i.e.: taking just the initials of every word); url will be always given in the format this-is-an-element-of-the-url and you should ignore words in this array while acronymizing: ["the","of","in","from","by","with","and", "or", "for", "to", "at", "a"]; a url composed of more words separated by - and equal or less than 30 characters long needs to be just uppercased with hyphens replaced by spaces.
#
# Ignore anchors (www.url.com#lameAnchorExample) and parameters (www.url.com?codewars=rocks&pippi=rocksToo) when present.

#You will always be provided valid url to webpages in common formats, so you probably shouldn't bother validating them.
